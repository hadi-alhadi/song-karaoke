                <p>I heard he sang a good song, I heard he had a style</p>
                <p>And so I came to see him, and listen for a while</p>
                <p>And there he was, this young boy, stranger to my eyes</p>
                <p>Strumming my pain with his fingers (one time, one time)</p>
                <p>Singing my life with his words (two times, two times)</p>
                <p>Killing me softly with his song</p>
                <p>Killing me softly with his song</p>
                <p>Telling my whole life with his words</p>
                <p>Killing me softly with his song</p>
                <p>I felt all flushed with fever, embarrassed by the crowd</p>
                <p>I felt he'd found my letters and read each one out loud</p>
                <p>I prayed that he would finish, but he just kept right on</p>
                <p>Strumming my pain with his fingers (one time, one time)</p>
                <p>Singing my life with his words (two times, two times)</p>
                <p>Killing me softly with his song</p>
                <p>Killing me softly with his song</p>
                <p>Telling my whole life with his words</p>
                <p>Killing me softly with his song</p>
                <p>Yo, L-Boog, take me to the bridge</p>

                <p>La-ah-ah-ah-ah</p>
                <p>Strumming my pain with his fingers (yes, he was singing my life)</p>
                <p>Singing my life with his words</p>
                <p>Killing me softly with his song</p>
                <p>Killing me softly with his song</p>
                <p>Telling my whole life with his words (whole life, with his words)</p>
